## _Asynchronous JavaScript And XML_

The appeal of AJAX is its "asynchronous" nature, which means that it can communicate with the server, exchange data and update the page without having to reload the browser.

### [XHR](/api/code/ajax/xhr.js)

XMLHttpRequest ( XHR ) is a special JavaScript object that allows asynchronous HTTP requests ( AJAX ) to be made natively from JavaScript.

### [Fetch](/api/code/ajax/fetch.js)

Fetch is the name of a new API for Javascript with which we can make asynchronous HTTP requests using promises and in a way that makes the code a little simpler.

### [Axios](/api/code/ajax/axios.js)

Promise-based library for making requests in Node or in browsers.
