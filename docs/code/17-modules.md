# Modules

Modules encapsulate all sorts of code like functions and variables and expose all this to other files.

The [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) declaration is used to export values from a JavaScript module.

The [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) syntax, commonly called dynamic import, is a function-like expression that allows loading an ECMAScript modules asynchronously and dynamically into a potentially non-module environment.
