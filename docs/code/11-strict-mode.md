# Strict mode

Strict mode applies to an entire script or to individual functions. To invoke strict mode on a
whole script, type exactly `"use strict";` before any other expression.

It enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the code at runtime. It also helps you write
cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that might otherwise go unnoticed.

```JS
"use strict";
// code
```
