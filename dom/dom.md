# Document Object Model

In Javascript, when we refer to the Document Object Model ( DOM ) we refer to this tree structure, through which we can access it and modify the HTML elements from Javascript.

## _Table of content_

- [Document](#document)

## _[Document](/dom/code/document.js)_

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

- Document
- HTML tags
- External document

## _[Select DOM element](/dom/code/select-dom-element.js)_

There are a number of methods that allow us to search the DOM of the page and find these elements.

- getElementById()
- querySelector()
- querySelectorAll()
